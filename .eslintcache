overcome, partly because of the accessibility to these substances.  Alcohol can be purchased at grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations.  The legalization of marijuana has made the drug much easier to procure. In America, other illicit drugs continue to flow into our communities. Sober living homes provide accountability, structure, and a sober environment for individuals getting readjusted to living life without drugs or alcohol.\n      </StdParagraph>\n      {/* <img src={blogImage2} className=\"w-2/6\" /> */}\n    {/* </div> */}\n\n    <StdParagraph>\n      Accountability is instrumental to living a sober life.  Most sober living houses require their tenants to keep their rooms and common areas clean, tenants must be working or looking for a job, and they’re randomly drug tested and breathalyzed. Additionally, sober livings that follow the 12-step model typically require proof of meeting attendance.  Most addicts and alcoholics isolate when in active addiction, this tendency frequently follows the recovering addict or alcoholic into recovery.  To combat isolation, most sober livings require multiple tenants to live in each room.  The typical structure and rule list follow:\n    </StdParagraph>\n\n\n    <BlogList>\n      <span className=\"font-semibold\">Structure / Rules</span>\n      <StyledList>\n        <ListItem>Weekly House Meetings</ListItem>\n        <ListItem>Curfew</ListItem>\n        <ListItem>Drug/alcohol screenings</ListItem>\n        <ListItem>12-step meeting attendance</ListItem>\n        <ListItem>Eviction clause for relapse</ListItem>\n        <ListItem>Roommates</ListItem>\n        <ListItem>Chores</ListItem>\n        <ListItem>Working or searching for work</ListItem>\n        <ListItem>Alcohol/Drug Free Environment</ListItem>\n      </StyledList>\n    </BlogList>\n\n    <StdParagraph>\n      A sober living environment is a great place for someone that is coming out of a residential treatment center.  Treatment centers should be vetting the sober livings that they recommend their patients go to after their residential treatment.  Sober living provides individuals with an opportunity to get back on their feet while being held accountable.  Sober living is also an option for people that are struggling in the ‘real world’, but don’t have the time or resources to go to residential treatment.  It provides people with a sense of community and fellowship which is an integral part of recovery.  Living fees are typically paid weekly, biweekly or monthly, as previously noted, relapse can be grounds for eviction.  A live-in sober manager typically administers drug and alcohol screening.\n    </StdParagraph>\n\n    <StdParagraph>\n      The bottom line is – sober living can be an excellent resource for individuals in recovery.  It offers an opportunity to live with like-minded people who are trying to better their lives.  Sober living also provides family members of the addict or alcoholic with peace-of-mind, knowing that their loved one is being held accountable.  The most valuable asset that sober living offers is a sense of community for its members.  The addict or alcoholic didn’t develop their addiction overnight, similarly, their addiction won’t be cured overnight.  It is important for people in recovery to utilize as many resources at their disposal as possible, starting with a substance-free environment to live in, with people who will be by their side through recovery.\n    </StdParagraph>\n  </div>\n\nexport default WhatIsSoberLiving;","/Users/charlie/Documents/git/intervention_site/src/components/BlogPosts/Arise.js",["134"],"import blogImage3 from \"../../assets/img/blogImage3.jpg\";\nimport { StdParagraph, BlogHeader, StyledH2, StyledSection, BlogList, StyledList, ListItem } from \"./utils\";\n\nconst AriseIntervention = () => \n  <div>\n    {/* <div> */}\n    <BlogHeader>ARISE® Comprehensive Care</BlogHeader>\n    <StdParagraph>\n      The ARISE® Comprehensive Care with Intervention is an Evidence-Based, Best Practice Continuum.  It is an intervention model that focuses on whole-family healing.  It utilizes an invitational and transparent approach to providing the family and person of concern (PoC) with the resources necessary to facilitate healing.  It achieves this by concentrating on treatment entry, completion, and continuing care, while supporting the family through the recovery process.

The ARISE® method consists of three levels that will escalate as needed to accomplish treatment engagement. The main goal of the process is treatment engagement by the person of concern (PoC) and a commitment by the intervention network to work towards long-term recovery and healing on a personal and family level for a minimum of 6-12 months. (Garrett et al., 1996; Garrett et al., 1997; Landau & Garrett, 2008).\n    </StdParagraph>\n\n    <StyledSection>\n      <StyledH2>Level 1 – The First Call</StyledH2>\n      <StdParagraph>The first level starts as soon as the initial contact is made by someone in the intervention network.  The ARISE® Interventionist coaches the first caller about the loved one struggling with substance abuse, mental health, or compulsive behavior disorder - to mobilize the extended family and support system to attend the first meeting.  (Landau & Garrett, 2008; Landau & Garrett, 2006; Garrett et al., 1999).</StdParagraph>\n\n      <BlogList>\n        <span className=\"font-semibold\">The main goals of the First Call are to:</span>\n        <StyledList>\n          <ListItem>Establish hope for the family</ListItem>\n          <ListItem>Determine who to invite to the first meeting</ListItem>\n          <ListItem>Identify a strategy to mobilize the intervention network</ListItem>\n          <ListItem>Develop a Recovery Message to be used as part of the invitation process</ListItem>\n          <ListItem>Receive commitment to attend first meeting from all potential members of intervention network</ListItem>\n          <ListItem>Organize how to invite the PoC to the first meeting</ListItem>\n        </StyledList>\n      </BlogList>\n\n      <StdParagraph>The foundation of this process revolves around the idea that the main goal is to stop the addiction from progressing into further generations of the family and that, oftentimes, the addiction started generations earlier.  The Recovery Message is designed to convey this, eliminating the blame, shame, and guilt of the PoC.  This Recovery Message is fine-tuned by the intervention network throughout the entire ARISE process. It is the basis for inviting members to the first meeting, originally being designed by the First Caller and ARISE® Interventionist. It goes from past through present to future, always incorporating the extent and gravity of the disease or family trauma at one end and the hope of recovery and healing without any further loss at the other.</StdParagraph>\n      <StdParagraph>The first meeting will occur regardless of whether or not the PoC joins the meeting. If the PoC engages in treatment, the focus of the process shifts to ARISE Comprehensive Care. If the PoC doesn’t engage in treatment, the process moves to Level 2.  The PoC is invited to all the Level 2 meetings and included on the emails that summarize each meeting.</StdParagraph>\n    </StyledSection>\n    \n    <StyledSection>\n      <StyledH2>Level 2 - Strength in Numbers</StyledH2>\n      <StdParagraph>Level 2 consists of one to three meetings that occur whether or not the PoC engages in the process.  The ARISE® interventionist works with the intervention network to identify ways to expand the intervention network.  This portion of the process revolves around the intervention network sticking together in their interactions with the PoC.  The focus is breaking the one-on-one interactions with the PoC.  This problem-solving phase includes identifying ways to handle the PoC’s resistance to entering treatment. The network speaks in unison, maintains uniform decisions and actions, and repeats the Recovery Message.  If the PoC hasn’t entered treatment at this stage, the Intervention Network decides whether to continue with Comprehensive Care or to proceed to Level 3.</StdParagraph>\n    </StyledSection>\n\n    <StyledSection>\n      <StyledH2>Level 3 – The Formal ARISE® Intervention</StyledH2> \n      <StdParagraph>\n        Level 3 is rarely used (2% of cases, Garrett et al., 1998; Landau et al., 2004). Level 3 only begins after the Intervention Network feels that Level 2 wasn’t successful and decides not to continue with Comprehensive Care.  At this point in the process, the PoC has declined numerous opportunities to engage in treatment.  The Formal ARISE® Intervention is a natural consequence and shouldn’t come as a surprise to the Person of Concern.  The PoC is invited to the meeting and informed that it will be a Level 3 meeting.  The Formal ARISE® Intervention utilizes the cohesion and strength of the Intervention Network to set stricter limits and consequences for the PoC if they refuse to seek treatment.\n      </StdParagraph>\n      \n      <StdParagraph>\n        If the PoC agrees to enter treatment, the network will continue to meet, shifting the focus to address early recovery, ambivalence issues. The Intervention Network then continues with Comprehensive Care while the PoC is in treatment.  The emphasis is on establishing accountability and an ongoing commitment to recovery goals and continued healing for all. If the PoC doesn’t enter treatment, Comprehensive Care to support the Network’s healing ensues. \n      </StdParagraph>\n    </StyledSection>\n\n    <StyledSection>\n      <StyledH2>ARISE® Comprehensive Care</StyledH2>\n\n      <BlogList>\n        <span className=\"font-semibold\">Comprehensive Care will begin in a variety of ways:</span>\n        <StyledList>\n          <ListItem>After a referral from a treatment provider to help support the PoC through the treatment process</ListItem>\n          <ListItem>To assist with the discharge process in preparation for collaborative continuing Comprehensive Care </ListItem>\n          <ListItem>To help the Intervention Network prevent the client from leaving AMA</ListItem>\n          <ListItem>When the PoC enters treatment</ListItem>\n          <ListItem>After the Level 3 meeting, regardless of the PoC’s decision about treatment</ListItem>\n          <ListItem>3 months after the beginning of the ARISE® process if the PoC hasn’t entered treatment</ListItem>\n        </StyledList>\n      </BlogList>\n\n      <StdParagraph>ARISE® Comprehensive Care continues for at least six months.

The true addict or alcoholic’s life will never improve without abstinence.  Typically, as their life continues to spiral, their family members, partners, and friends are left to pick up the pieces.  Family members almost always exhaust their personal resources attempting to help their loved one.  They spend countless nights worrying about the safety and health of their loved one.  Seeking professional help is the first step for families that are battling addiction. </StdParagraph>\n    <StdParagraph>Addiction is the only disease that requires a self-diagnosis in order to receive successful treatment.  If someone doesn’t realize they have a problem, they will not seek treatment.  Even when individuals realize they have a problem, that doesn’t always mean they’re ready to make a change.  The addict or alcoholic’s problem didn’t occur overnight, similarly, the process of getting sober takes a lot of time and effort to facilitate true healing.  Healing needs to occur for both the addicted individual and their loved ones. </StdParagraph>\n    <StdParagraph>There are a variety of treatment services available for substance abuse and alcoholism, but if the person isn’t ready to change, those services are virtually useless.  The goal of an intervention process is to help the addict or alcoholic realize they need to seek help.  Once they come to the conclusion that they need help, these addiction treatment services become much more effective.</StdParagraph>\n    <StdParagraph>There are a variety of different proven intervention modalities that are utilized in the field.  Each situation is different, depending on the situation, one modality might be more effective than the others.  The first step for the interventionist is to get a better understanding of the situation and what has been transpiring with the addict or alcoholic.  Once this information is collected, the interventionist will inform the family about his or her recommended intervention method.  Once the intervention method is determined, the process will move forward within that individual framework.</StdParagraph>\n    <StdParagraph>The foundation of each intervention method is set upon several key principles.  Each method requires a lot of planning and communication.  The interventionist will help families set direct, but loving boundaries with the person of concern.  Finally, the intervention is just as important for the family’s healing as it is the addict or alcoholic’s recovery.  The goal is always to assist the addict or alcoholic in realizing that they need to get help.  These conversations can be extremely intense and difficult to manage for families.  The interventionist is there to help facilitate the process and ensure that it goes smoothly.  These are very emotional situations, and it is useful to have someone there who isn’t directly involved or affected by the person’s addiction.  At the end of the day, the interventionist is there to get the person of concern the proper level of care that they need, and to ensure the process is handled safely.</StdParagraph>\n
