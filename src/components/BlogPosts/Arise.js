    <BlogHeader>ARISE® Comprehensive Care</BlogHeader>
    <StdParagraph>
      The ARISE® Comprehensive Care with Intervention is an Evidence-Based, Best Practice Continuum.  It is an intervention model that focuses on whole-family healing.  It utilizes an invitational and transparent approach to providing the family and person of concern (PoC) with the resources necessary to facilitate healing.  It achieves this by concentrating on treatment entry, completion, and continuing care, while supporting the family through the recovery process.  The ARISE® method is navigated by a trained professional using a manual-driven system.

    <StdParagraph>
      This intervention model is designed to eliminate the blame, shame, and guilt around addiction.  The ARISE® method consists of three levels that will escalate as needed to accomplish treatment engagement. The main goal of the process is treatment engagement by the person of concern (PoC) and a commitment by the intervention network to work towards long-term recovery and healing on a personal and family level for a minimum of 6-12 months. (Garrett et al., 1996; Garrett et al., 1997; Landau & Garrett, 2008).

      <StyledH2>Level 1 – The First Call</StyledH2>
      <StdParagraph>The first level starts as soon as the initial contact is made by someone in the intervention network.  The ARISE® Interventionist coaches the first caller about the loved one struggling with substance abuse, mental health, or compulsive behavior disorder - to mobilize the extended family and support system to attend the first meeting.  (Landau & Garrett, 2008; Landau & Garrett, 2006; Garrett et al., 1999).</StdParagraph>

      <StdParagraph>The foundation of this process revolves around the idea that the main goal is to stop the addiction from progressing into further generations of the family and that, oftentimes, the addiction started generations earlier.  The Recovery Message is designed to convey this, eliminating the blame, shame, and guilt of the PoC.  This Recovery Message is fine-tuned by the intervention network throughout the entire ARISE process. It is the basis for inviting members to the first meeting, originally being designed by the First Caller and ARISE® Interventionist. It goes from past through present to future, always incorporating the extent and gravity of the disease or family trauma at one end and the hope of recovery and healing without any further loss at the other.</StdParagraph>
      <StdParagraph>The first meeting will occur regardless of whether or not the PoC joins the meeting. If the PoC engages in treatment, the focus of the process shifts to ARISE Comprehensive Care. If the PoC doesn’t engage in treatment, the process moves to Level 2.  The PoC is invited to all the Level 2 meetings and included on the emails that summarize each meeting.</StdParagraph>

      <StyledH2>Level 2 - Strength in Numbers</StyledH2>
      <StdParagraph>Level 2 consists of one to three meetings that occur whether or not the PoC engages in the process.  The ARISE® interventionist works with the intervention network to identify ways to expand the intervention network.  This portion of the process revolves around the intervention network sticking together in their interactions with the PoC.  The focus is breaking the one-on-one interactions with the PoC.  This problem-solving phase includes identifying ways to handle the PoC’s resistance to entering treatment. The network speaks in unison, maintains uniform decisions and actions, and repeats the Recovery Message.  If the PoC hasn’t entered treatment at this stage, the Intervention Network decides whether to continue with Comprehensive Care or to proceed to Level 3.</StdParagraph>

      <StyledH2>Level 3 – The Formal ARISE® Intervention</StyledH2> 
      <StdParagraph>
        Level 3 is rarely used (2% of cases, Garrett et al., 1998; Landau et al., 2004). Level 3 only begins after the Intervention Network feels that Level 2 wasn’t successful and decides not to continue with Comprehensive Care.  At this point in the process, the PoC has declined numerous opportunities to engage in treatment.  The Formal ARISE® Intervention is a natural consequence and shouldn’t come as a surprise to the Person of Concern.  The PoC is invited to the meeting and informed that it will be a Level 3 meeting.  The Formal ARISE® Intervention utilizes the cohesion and strength of the Intervention Network to set stricter limits and consequences for the PoC if they refuse to seek treatment.
      </StdParagraph>
      
      <StdParagraph>
        If the PoC agrees to enter treatment, the network will continue to meet, shifting the focus to address early recovery, ambivalence issues. The Intervention Network then continues with Comprehensive Care while the PoC is in treatment.  The emphasis is on establishing accountability and an ongoing commitment to recovery goals and continued healing for all. If the PoC doesn’t enter treatment, Comprehensive Care to support the Network’s healing ensues.

      <StdParagraph>ARISE® Comprehensive Care continues for at least six months.  This portion of the process is utilized to empower the family to continue the change that started at the beginning of this process.  The goal is to give the family the tools they need to fully heal and address these situations as a family in the future.  It is also an opportunity to support the PoC in their recovery.</StdParagraph>

      <StdParagraph>As the process comes to a close, the emphasis shifts from crisis management to ensuring the family has the tools to no longer carry addiction or destructive behaviors into further generations. The family will have developed life management skills and re-learned healthy ways of interacting together. Ideally, the family will continue with their own family meetings long after the ARISE® process is finished. </StdParagraph>
